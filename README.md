# clock
This is a small Python program that I wrote myself where I create a countdown clock. You can adjust the hours and minutes as you like,
and when it counts down to zero, it will automatically ring to signal the end of time. 

This program is quite simple, very suitable for beginners to code 
and get acquainted with the Pygame library as well as the Python programming language.
